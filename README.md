# Unet-based Image Colorization
This project implements a neural network for image colorization using the popular Unet architecture. While Unet is typically used for image segmentation tasks, it can also be used for image reconstruction and colorization.

# Installation
To install the required packages, run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Usage
To use the trained network to generate colorized images, run:
```
python inference.py --weight_path ./weights/weight.pt --input_path ./images --output_path ./output --plot
```
You can specify the path to the trained weights, the input directory containing grayscale images, the output directory to save colorized images, and whether or not to display the images.

# Output
         Gray Scale Image		         Random Pixel		       Output	              Ground Truth

# Training
The network was trained on the COCO dataset using a customized dataloader that randomly selects only 0.1% of the actual image pixels for conditional colorization. Due to limited resources, the network was trained for only 2 epochs.
